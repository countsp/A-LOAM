# A-LOAM
## Advanced implementation of LOAM

A-LOAM is an Advanced implementation of LOAM (J. Zhang and S. Singh. LOAM: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time), which uses Eigen and Ceres Solver to simplify code structure. This code is modified from LOAM and [LOAM_NOTED](https://github.com/cuitaixiang/LOAM_NOTED). This code is clean and simple without complicated mathematical derivation and redundant operations. It is a good learning material for SLAM beginners.

**Modifier:** [Tong Qin](http://www.qintonguav.com), [Shaozu Cao](https://github.com/shaozu)

only supports 16/32/64 scans lidar


## 1. Prerequisites
### 1.1 **Ubuntu** and **ROS**
Ubuntu 64-bit 16.04 or 18.04.
ROS Kinetic or Melodic. [ROS Installation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation)

Ubuntu 20.04 Noetic
[Installation Guide](https://blog.csdn.net/weixin_43910370/article/details/120736760c.)



### 1.2. **Ceres Solver** (not verified)
Follow [Ceres Installation](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html).

### 1.3. **PCL** (not verified)
Follow [PCL Installation](http://www.pointclouds.org/downloads/linux.html).


## 2. Build A-LOAM
Clone the repository and catkin_make:

```
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/cgbcgb/A-LOAM-NOTED.git ~/aloam_noted_ws/src
```

将四个.cpp文件中的'/camera_init'修改为'camera_init'

将scanRegistration.cpp中的 '#include <opencv/cv.h> '修改为'#include <opencv2/imgproc.hpp>'

修改kittiHelper.cpp中 'CV_LOAD_IMAGE_GRAYSCALE'为 'cv::IMREAD_GRAYSCALE'

aloam_noted_ws->src->a-loam->CMakeLists.txt 添加
    
```
set( CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)
```

```
    cd aloam_noted_ws
    catkin_make
    source ~/aloam_noted_ws/devel/setup.bash
```




## 3. Velodyne VLP-16 Example
Download [NSH indoor outdoor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s05tBQOLNEDDurlg48KiUWxCp-YqYyGH/view) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER. 

```
    cd aloam_noted_ws/src/launch
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_VLP_16.launch
    rosbag play ~/bagfiles/nsh_indoor_outdoor.bag
```


## 4. KITTI Example (Velodyne HDL-64)
Download [KITTI Odometry dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) to YOUR_DATASET_FOLDER and set the `dataset_folder` and `sequence_number` parameters in `kitti_helper.launch` file. Note you also convert KITTI dataset to bag file for easy use by setting proper parameters in `kitti_helper.launch`. 

```
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne aloam_velodyne_HDL_64.launch
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne kitti_helper.launch
```

## 5. Docker Support
To further facilitate the building process, we add docker in our code. Docker environment is like a sandbox, thus makes our code environment-independent. To run with docker, first make sure [ros](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) are installed on your machine. Then add your account to `docker` group by `sudo usermod -aG docker $YOUR_USER_NAME`. **Relaunch the terminal or logout and re-login if you get `Permission denied` error**, type:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/A-LOAM/docker
make build
```
The build process may take a while depends on your machine. After that, run `./run.sh 16` or `./run.sh 64` to launch A-LOAM, then you should be able to see the result.
